# stfmr
Library of modules for analysis of ST-FMR data acquired with the RT ST-FMR setup at MPI Halle. 
The ground work of the code including, inter alia, the data handling, Lorentzian fitting etc. was laid by Avanindra Kumar Pandeya. Modules for further analysis (line shape, line width, angle-dependence, RF current calibration, inter alia) were later added by Berthold Henry Rimmler.

Some modules require Berthold's analysis-modules base library, available on request.
